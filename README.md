## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the **mask-rcnn-instance-segmentation-opencv** project. This application helps you perform instance segmentation using the Mask R-CNN model. It is built with OpenCV and provides a command-line interface (CLI). You will find it easy to use, even if you have no technical background.

## 📋 Features
- Perform instance segmentation with state-of-the-art models.
- Generate outputs that are easy to understand and visualize.
- Run in a headless setup, making it friendly for servers and other non-GUI environments.
- Supports images in the COCO dataset format, commonly used in computer vision tasks.
- Lightweight and efficient, designed to run on most modern computers.

## 💻 System Requirements
To run this application, you will need:
- A computer with Windows, MacOS, or Linux.
- Python 3.6 or higher installed.
- OpenCV library Binaries. You can install them using pip: 
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
  ```
- Min of 2GB RAM for smooth processing.

## 📥 Download & Install
To get started, you will first need to download the software:

1. **Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/siddheshk08/mask-rcnn-instance-segmentation-opencv/releases)**.
2. Click on the latest version link. You will find a .zip or .exe file, depending on your system.
3. Download the file onto your computer.
4. If it's a .zip file, extract it to a folder of your choice.
5. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the folder where you extracted the files or where you placed the .exe file.
6. Run the command:
   ```bash
   python mask_rcnn_instance_segmentation.py [your-image-path]
   ```
   or simply double-click the .exe file. Replace `[your-image-path]` with the path of the image you want to process.

## ⚙️ How to Use the Command Line
Once you have installed the application, follow these steps to run your first segmentation:

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac or Linux).
2. Navigate to the directory containing the application files.
3. Use the following command to start the instance segmentation:
   ```bash
   python mask_rcnn_instance_segmentation.py path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```
4. The application will process your image and produce an output image with annotated segments.

## 📖 Understanding the Output
The output image will contain colored masks for each detected object. These masks make it clear which items have been detected in the original image. The application saves the output in the same directory as the input image, usually appending `_segmented` to the filename.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, check the following:
- Make sure Python is properly installed and available from your command prompt or terminal.
- Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You might want to run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Double-check that you are using a compatible image format (JPEG, PNG, etc.).

## 📊 Example Usage
Suppose you have an image named `example.jpg`. You would run:
```bash
python mask_rcnn_instance_segmentation.py example.jpg
```
After processing, the application saves `example_segmented.jpg` in the same folder.
